# Summary

Caliban is a command line tool that helps researchers launch and track their
numerical experiments in an isolated, reproducible computing environment. It was
developed by machine learning researchers and engineers, and makes it easy to go
from a simple prototype running on a workstation to thousands of experimental
jobs running in a Cloud environment.

# Motivation

Modern machine learning research typically requires a researcher to execute code
in multiple computing environments. To investigate some property of a machine
learning model, the researcher has to write a script that can accept a path to
some dataset, train a model using some set of configurable parameters, and
generate measurements or a serialized model for later analysis.

Writing and debugging model training code is fastest on a local workstation.
Running the script to generate measurements almost always takes place on some
much more powerful machine, typically in a Cloud environment. The [imagenet
dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/imagenet2012) [@deng2009imagenet]
is 144 GiB, for example, far too large to process on a stock laptop.

Moving between these environments almost always causes tremendous pain. In
Python, a common language for machine learning research, the researcher installs
their script's dependencies in a system-wide package registry. The Cloud
environment can have different dependencies available, or different versions of
the same dependency; different versions of Python itself; or different software
drivers, which elicit different behavior from the script that seemed to work
locally.

This environment mismatch introduces tremendous friction into the research
process. The only way to debug a script that succeeds locally and fails in a
remote Cloud environment is to attempt to interpret the often-cryptic error
logs.

## Docker

One solution to this problem is Docker [@merkel2014docker]. A researcher can
package their code and dependencies inside of a Docker container and execute
this container on different platforms, each with different hardware options
available but with a consistent software environment.

Many Cloud services (Google's [Cloud AI
Platform](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform), [Amazon
Sagemaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) etc) allow users to submit and
execute Docker containers that they've built locally.

Packaging research code inside of a Docker container has many benefits for
reproducibility [@cito2016]. But the process of building a Docker container is
difficult, error-prone and almost totally orthogonal to the skill set of a
machine learning researcher. The friction of debugging between local and Cloud
environments is solved, but only by accepting a not-insignificant baseline level
of pain into the local development experience.

Projects like [MLFlow](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/projects.html)
[@zaharia2018accelerating] attempt to streamline the container creation process,
but still force the researcher's to absorb much of Docker's mental model.

# Caliban and Reproducible Research

Caliban is a command line tool that solves this problem by providing execution
modes with opinionated, intuitive interfaces for each phase of machine learning
research - interactive development, local execution, cloud execution and data
analysis in a notebook environment.

With Caliban, the researcher executes all code using Caliban's various
subcommands. This process is, for the researcher, just as easy as executing code
directly. To prepare a research environment, all they need to do is specify
required packages in a `requirements.txt` file and Caliban will automatically
make those dependencies available inside the container.

Behind the scenes, all software execution has moved inside of a Docker
container. This makes it transparent to move that execution from a local
environment to Cloud, enabling a research project to grow from a simple
prototype running on a workstation to thousands of experimental jobs running on
Cloud with little to no cognitive load.

This removal of friction allows a researcher the freedom to be creative in ways
that their psychology simply wouldn't allow, given the typical pain caused by
moves between environments.

In addition, Caliban makes it easy to launch multiple jobs with varying
command-line arguments with a single command, using experiment configuration
files.

# Impact

Before we introduced Caliban in our lab, researchers reported spending multiple
weeks learning how to run their experiments at scale. Caliban allows a new
researcher to reach this level of proficiency in under an hour. Multiple papers
currently in preparation contain research results generated from thousands of
experiments executed using Caliban. Given the limited tenure of a typical
machine learning internship and residency, the efficiency boost offered by
Caliban can materially change the scope of project that a researcher would be
willing to take on.

In addition, any research conducted with Caliban that the researcher open
sources is trivially executable by any interested party. The Docker environment
managed by Caliban guarantees that anyone with access to the shared source code
repository will be able to run experiments in an environment identical to the
environment used in the original research program.

# Caliban's Execution Environments

Caliban provides a suite of execution engines that can execute the containers
built by Caliban.

[`caliban
shell`](https://caliban.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli/caliban_shell.html)
generates a Docker image containing any dependencies declared in a
`requirements.txt` and/or `setup.py` in a project's directory and opens an
interactive shell. Any update to code in the project's folder will be reflected
immediately inside the container environment. The `caliban shell` environment is
identical to the environment available during Cloud execution, up to access to
different hardware.

[`caliban
notebook`](https://caliban.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli/caliban_notebook.html)
starts a Jupyter notebook or lab instance inside of a Docker image containing
the project's dependencies. As with `caliban shell`, the environment available
to the notebook is identical to the Cloud environment.

[`caliban run`](https://caliban.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli/caliban_run.html)
packages a project's code into a Docker container and executes it locally using
`docker run`. If the local machine has access to a GPU, the instance will attach
to it by default, with no need to configure drivers.

[`caliban
cloud`](https://caliban.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli/caliban_cloud.html) allows
a researcher to [submit a research script to Google's AI
Platform](https://caliban.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/cloud.html).
The code will run inside the same Docker container available with all other
subcommands. Researchers can submit hundreds of jobs at once. Any machine type,
GPU count, and GPU type combination specified will be validated client side,
instead of requiring a round trip to the server.

[`caliban
build`](https://caliban.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli/caliban_build.html) builds
the Docker image used in `caliban cloud` and `caliban run` without actually
running the container or submitting any code.

[`caliban
cluster`](https://caliban.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli/caliban_cluster.html)
allows a researcher to create and submit jobs to a Kubernetes cluster. This
environment is superficially similar to the Cloud environment offered by
Google's AI Platform and `caliban cloud`, but a different range of hardware and
pricing is available to the researcher.

[`caliban
status`](https://caliban.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli/caliban_status.html)
displays information about all jobs submitted by Caliban, and allows a
researcher to cancel, inspect or resubmit large groups of experiments.
