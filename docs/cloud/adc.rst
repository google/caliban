Application Default Credentials
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Instead of a service account key, you might also generate "Application Default
Credentials" on your machine.

To install these on your workstation, run

.. code-block:: bash

   gcloud auth application-default login

at your terminal, as described in `these gcloud docs
<https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/application-default/login>`_.
That's it!
